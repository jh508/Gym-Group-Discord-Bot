# Gym Group Discord Bot

A serverless discord bot which utilizes AWS Lambda expressions for posting information about my local gym. This helps me schedule sessions around the quietest times.

## Why?

I LOVE working out. However, sometimes my gym sessions feel like I'm in a long queue to enter a concert! Busy Gyms can interrupt your workout significantly, sometimes making it so you need to find alternative machines or maybe even skip working a particular muscle group. This bot was designed to notify me on Discord at specific times with information about the gym so I can schedule my sessions around the quietest times. 

## Can I use this project?

This project is specific to my local gym. However, it is very much possible to alter the code and calculations to be specific to your gym. You just need to figure out the maximum capacity and enter your branch ID.
